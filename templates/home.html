        <p>
          Bitcoin is a form of digital currency that aims to disregard the need for central authorities such as banks or governments.
           Instead, Bitcoin uses blockchain technology to support peer-to-peer transactions between users on a decentralized network.
          Transactions are authenticated through Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism, which rewards cryptocurrency miners for validating 
          transactions.Launched in 2009 by a mysterious developer known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin (BTC) was the first,
          and remains the most valuable, contributor in the emerging class of assets known as cryptocurrencies.

        <h3>Working of Bitcoin:</h3>
        <p>
          Each Bitcoin is a digital asset that can be stored at a cryptocurrency exchange or in a digital wallet. Each individual coin represents the value of Bitcoin’s current price, but you can also own partial shares of each coin. The smallest denomination of each Bitcoin is called a Satoshi, sharing its name with Bitcoin’s creator. Each Satoshi is equivalent to a hundred millionth of one Bitcoin, so owning fractional shares of Bitcoin is quite common.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Blockchain:</b> Bitcoin is powered by open-source code known as blockchain, which creates a shared public history of 
            transactions organized into "blocks" that are "chained" together to prevent tampering. This technology creates a permanent
             record of each transaction, and it provides a way for every Bitcoin user to operate with the same understanding of who owns 
             what.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Private and public keys:</b> A Bitcoin wallet contains a public key and a private key, which work together to allow 
            the owner to initiate and digitally sign transactions. This cracks the central function of Bitcoin — securely transferring
             ownership from one user to another.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Bitcoin mining:</b> Users on the Bitcoin network verify transactions through a process known as mining, which is designed
             to confirm that new transactions are dependable with other transactions that have been completed in the past. This ensures 
             that you can’t spend a Bitcoin you don’t have, or that you have previously spent.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Bitcoin making Money:</h3>
        <div class="col-2">
          <div class="btc-left"> 
            <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='mining.avif')}}" height="220px" width="250px">
          </div>
        <p>
          New Bitcoins are created as part of the Bitcoin mining process, in which they are offered as a worthwhile reward to people who 
          operate computer systems that help to validate transactions. Bitcoin miners — also known as "nodes" — are the owners of high 
          speed computers which independently confirm each transaction, and add a completed "block" of transactions to the ever-growing
          "chain." The resulting blockchain is a complete, public and permanent record of every Bitcoin transaction.Miners are then paid 
          in Bitcoin for their efforts, which incentivizes the decentralized network to independently verify each transaction.
          This independent network of miners also decreases the chance for fraud or false information to be recorded, as the majority
          of miners need to confirm the authenticity of each block of data before it's added to the blockchain in a process known as 
          proof-of-work.

        <h3>Bitcoin pros:</h3>
        <div class="col-1"><p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Cost-efficient transactions and fast speeds.</b>Once you own Bitcoin, you can make transfers anytime, anywhere, reducing 
            the time and potential expense of any transaction.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Privacy.</b>Transactions don’t contain personal information, such as a name or credit card number. While it’s still 
            possible to link a certain person to a certain wallet, transactions are generally more private than credit card transactions,
             for example.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Decentralization.</b>After the financial crisis and the Great Downturn, some investors are eager to embrace an alternative,
             decentralized currency — one that is essentially outside the control of regular banks, governing authorities or other third
              parties.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Growth potential.</b>Some investors who buy and hold the currency are betting that once Bitcoin matures, greater trust 
            and more widespread use will follow, and therefore Bitcoin’s value will grow.
          </li>

          </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Price volatility.</b>While Bitcoin's value has risen dramatically over the years, buyers' fortunes have varied widely 
            depending on the timing of their investment. Those who bought in 2017 when Bitcoin’s price was racing toward $20,000, for 
            example, had to wait until December 2020 to recover their losses. More recently, Bitcoin’s price began 2022 slightly over 
            $47,000 per coin. After a tough year for cryptocurrency in general, Bitcoin has slumped to its current price of just under
             $17,000.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Hacking concerns.</b>While backers say the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin is even more secure than traditional 
            electronic money transfers, there have been a number of high-profile hacks. In May 2019, for instance, more than $40 million 
            in Bitcoin was stolen from several high-net-worth accounts on the cryptocurrency exchange Binance.

          <p>Giving longer-term price targets for bitcoin in 2030, DigitalCoinPrice, as of 6 April 2023, suggested that the

            potential $124,750.16 and PricePrediction claimed it could trade at $252,816.76 in five years time. However, price
             predictions very often turn out to be wrong and prices can, and do, go down as well as up.

          <p>According to Telegaon’s prediction as of 23 March 2023, bitcoin could trade at $175,109.22 in 2030, and more than double

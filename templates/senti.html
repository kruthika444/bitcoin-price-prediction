           affect a market, assisting as a forecasting tool to determine possible future price changes in a particular asset.
           There are various factors that influence crypto sentiment, which include news (economic, political and industry related)
          and social media. These factors help influence crypto sentiment as they impact crypto market volatility, trading volume 
          and company earnings.

        <p>Even though cryptocurrencies is starting to see mainstream adoption, social media still has a prominent role. As well as growing the cryptocurrency space, social media is beginning to educate people on blockchain technology and the impact it can have on all industries. If you wish to be updated with news in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, you must turn to social media. In particular, Reddit is exceptionally active in Bitcoin; the Bitcoin subreddit will teach you everything you need to know on the topic. When you read breaking cryptocurrency news, journalists probably pulled the information from Reddit.</p>
        <p>Social media will continue to drive up interest and adoption in cryptocurrency and blockchain. Even further, blockchain technology could be responsible for entirely decentralized social media. If this happens, the public will run the platform, and there will be no censorship on what can be posted. Blockchain social media would spell the epitome of the relationship between the two.</p>
        <p>Cryptocurrency is here to stay, and social media is responsible for driving up interest and launching it into the mainstream. The relationship outlined above will continue to shift and evolve as time moves on.</p>
